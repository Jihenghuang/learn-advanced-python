Logging is a handy tool in a programmer‚Äôs toolbox. It can helps develop a better understanding of the flow of a program and discover scenarios that you might not even have thought of while developing. This is doubly true for non-interactive programs, such as batch processing, servers and calculations running in a cluster.

Logs provide developers with an ability to monitor in detail the progress and errors and flow of information in an application. They often store information, for example usernames or IP addresses accessed the application. If an error occurs, logs can provide more insights than a stack trace by telling you what the state of the program was before it arrived at the line of code where the error occurred.

By logging useful data from the right places, you can find and fix errors easily but also use the data to analyze the performance of the application to plan for scaling or look at usage patterns to plan for marketing.

## The logging funnel
The key to understanding how logging works is knowing that it encourages you to log a lot of data, and then gives multiple mechanisms for filtering out that data. It‚Äôs similar to a funnel. Lots of data goes in, but most of it gets filtered out before leaving the system as formatted logs 

![](https://i0.wp.com/djangodeconstructed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LogFunnel-1.png?zoom=1.25&resize=551%2C471&ssl=1)




Why does it work this way? Because that leads to simple application code (just log everything!) that stays the same from environment to environment. Filters can then be configured via settings and config files to match the environment. If you‚Äôre debugging locally you may want to filter nothing out and create log records of everything. But on production, you only want to know about errors, in which case you can add more filters (i.e. the funnel gets much more narrow).

## Historical background: Log4J
Logging in python is heavily influenced by a logging paradigm popularized by the [log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j) library for the Java language.
log4j offered a framework built on Hierarchial loggers and a root logger, log levels, appenders, and layout objects, and inspired ports in many other languages, including: C/C++, Perl, JavaScript, C# etc

# Basics



## The Logging Module
The logging module in Python is a ready-to-use and powerful module that is designed to meet the needs of beginners as well as enterprise teams. It is used by most of the third-party Python libraries, so you can integrate your log messages with the ones from those libraries to produce a homogeneous log for your application.

Adding logging to your Python program is as easy as this:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
import logging

```
</div>

</div>



With the logging module imported, you can use something called a ‚Äúlogger‚Äù to log messages that you want to see. By default, there are 5 standard levels indicating the severity of events. Each has a corresponding method that can be used to log events at that level of severity. The defined levels, in order of increasing severity, are the following:

![](https://www.dev2qa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/log4j-log-levels-desc.png)

   * DEBUG      
   * INFO     
   * WARNING    
   * ERROR    
   * CRITICAL    



The logging module provides you with a default logger that allows you to get started without needing to do much configuration. The corresponding methods for each level can be called as shown in the following example:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')

logging.basicConfig()

logger.debug('This is my üòÇ debug message ')
logger.info('This is my üíú info message ')
logger.warning('This is my ü§î warning message ')
logger.error('This is my error üò±message ')
logger.critical('This is my üò≠ critical message ')

```
</div>

</div>



Lets unpack what's happening here:

1. The output lines start with `WARNING` / `ERROR` / `CRITICAL` which are the severility levels we used
2. followed by `my_logger:` - this is the name of the __logger__ We're logging through (Loggers are discussed in detail in later sections.) 
3. followed by our custom error message

This format, which shows the level, name, and message separated by a colon (:), is the default __output format__ that can be configured to include things like timestamp, line number, and other details.

> Notice that the `debug()` and `info()` messages didn‚Äôt get logged. This is because, by default, the logging module logs the messages with a __severity level of WARNING or above__. You can change that by configuring the logging module to log events of all levels if you want. You can also define your own severity levels by changing configurations, but it is generally not recommended as it can cause confusion with logs of some third-party libraries that you might be using.



## Basic Configurations

You can use the `basicConfig(**kwargs)` method to configure the root logger (more on that later):

> ‚ÄúYou will notice that the logging module breaks PEP8 styleguide and uses camelCase naming conventions. This is because it was adopted from Log4j, a logging utility in Java. It is a known issue in the package but by the time it was decided to add it to the standard library, it had already been adopted by users and changing it to meet PEP8 requirements would cause backwards compatibility issues.‚Äù ([Source](https://wiki.python.org/moin/LoggingPackage))

Some of the commonly used parameters for `basicConfig()` are the following:

- `level`: The root logger will be set to the specified severity level.
- `filename`: This specifies the file.
- `filemode`: If filename is given, the file is opened in this mode. The default is a, which means append.
- `format`: This is the format of the log message.

Example: By using the `level` parameter, you can set what level of log messages you want to record. This can be done by passing one of the constants available in the class, and this would enable all logging calls at or above that level to be logged. Here‚Äôs an example:




<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG # allow DEBUG level messages to pass through the logger
    )

logging.debug('This WILL get logged')

```
</div>

</div>



All events at or above DEBUG level will now get logged.




> It should be noted that usually calling `basicConfig()` to configure the root logger works only if the root logger has not been configured before. Basically, this function should usually only be called once. 



You can customize the root logger even further by using more parameters for basicConfig(), which can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.basicConfig).

The default setting in `basicConfig()` is to set the logger to write to the console in the following format:

```
ERROR:root:This is an error message
```



## Logging Variable Data

In most cases, you would want to include dynamic information from your application in the logs. You have seen that the logging methods take a string as an argument, and it might seem natural to format a string with variable data in a separate line and pass it to the log method. But this can actually be done directly by using a format string for the message and appending the variable data as arguments. Here‚Äôs an example (using Python's older C-style % string formatting):



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')

logging.basicConfig()

name = 'Aviad'
logger.error('A person called "%s" raised an error', name)

```
</div>

</div>



The arguments passed to the method would be included as variable data in the message.

If you're unfamiliar with the %-based style, the f-strings introduced in Python 3.6 are an awesome way to format strings as they can help keep the formatting short and easy to read:




<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')

logging.basicConfig()

name = 'Aviad'
logger.error(f'A person called "{name}" raised an error')

```
</div>

</div>



> Note: when using f-string formatting, pass just one fully formatted string to the logger functions



# Configurations



## Logging to file

> from this point on, we're going to do quite a bit of usage of the Path object to handle files and folders, so lets import it



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
from pathlib import Path

```
</div>

</div>



`basicConfig()`can be used to configure logging to output to a file rather than the console. filename and filemode parameters are used, and you can decide the format of the message using format. The following example shows the usage of all three:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')

logging.basicConfig(
    filename='app.log', # write to this file
    filemode='a', # open in append mode
    format='%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
    )

logging.warning('This will get logged to a file')

```
</div>

</div>



now logging does not write to console anymore, but instead to the specified file:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
print(Path('app.log').read_text())

```
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper" markdown="1">
<div class="output_subarea" markdown="1">
{:.output_stream}
```
root - WARNING - This will get logged to a file
root - WARNING - This will get logged to a file
root - WARNING - This will get logged to a file

```
</div>
</div>
</div>



## Formatting the Output

While you can pass any variable that can be represented as a string from your program as a message to your logs, there are some basic elements that are already a part of the LogRecord and can be easily added to the output format. If you want to log the process ID along with the level and message, you can do something like this:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')

logging.basicConfig(format='ID:%(process)d - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
logger.warning('This Warning contains the process ID of the process who logged it')

```
</div>

</div>



`format=` can take a string with `LogRecord` attributes in any arrangement you like. The entire list of available attributes can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes).

Here‚Äôs another example where you can add the date and time info:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')

logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)
logger.info('This message has a date/time timestamp')

```
</div>

</div>



`%(asctime)s` adds the time of creation of the `LogRecord`. The format can be changed using the `datefmt` attribute, which uses the same formatting language as the formatting functions in the `datetime` module, such as `time.strftime()`:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')

logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s', datefmt='%d-%b-%y %H:%M:%S')
logger.warning('Date looks different for this message')

```
</div>

</div>



You can find the date/time formatting guide [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior).



## Anatomy of logging module: Classes and Functions

So far, we have seen the default logger named root, which is used by the logging module whenever its functions are called directly like this: `logging.debug()`. You can (and should) define your own logger by creating an object of the Logger class, especially if your application has multiple modules. Let‚Äôs have a look at some of the classes and functions in the module.

The most commonly used classes defined in the logging module are the following:

- `Logger`: This is the class whose objects will be used in the application code directly to call the functions.

- `LogRecord`: Loggers automatically create LogRecord objects that have all the information related to the event being logged, like the name of the logger, the function, the line number, the message, and more.

- `Handler`: Handlers send the LogRecord to the required output destination, like the console or a file. Handler is a base for subclasses like StreamHandler, FileHandler, SMTPHandler, HTTPHandler, and more. These subclasses send the logging outputs to corresponding destinations, like sys.stdout or a disk file.

- `Formatter`: This is where you specify the format of the output by specifying a string format that lists out the attributes that the output should contain.

we'll talk more in depth about all of these below, right now we're keeping to the basics.

Out of these, we mostly deal directly with the objects of the Logger class, which are instantiated using the module-level function `logging.getLogger(name)`. Multiple calls to `getLogger()` with the same name will return a reference to the same Logger object, which saves us from passing the logger objects to every part where it‚Äôs needed. 

Here‚Äôs an example:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging
logging.basicConfig() # setup basic formatting for the root logger

logger = logging.getLogger('example_logger')
logger.warning('This is a warning')

```
</div>

</div>



This creates a custom logger named _example_logger_. 

it inherits the the handler and formatting from the _root_ logger, is why it outputs to console, and uses the same formatting as the root logger



> ‚ÄúIt is recommended that we use module-level loggers by passing `__name__` as the name parameter to `getLogger()` to create a logger object as the name of the logger itself would tell us from where the events are being logged. `__name__` is a special built-in variable in Python which evaluates to the name of the current module.‚Äù ([Source](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logger-objects))





## Using Handlers
Handlers come into the picture when you want to configure your own loggers and send the logs to multiple places when they are generated. Handlers send the log messages to configured destinations like the standard output stream or a file or over HTTP or to your email via SMTP.

A logger that you create can have more than one handler, which means you can set it up to be saved to a log file and also send it over email.

Like loggers, you can also set the severity level in handlers. This is useful if you want to set multiple handlers for the same logger but want different severity levels for each of them. For example, you may want logs with level WARNING and above to be logged to the console, but everything with level ERROR and above should also be saved to a file. 

For Here‚Äôs a program that does configures handlers with code:
> NOTE: as we will see later in this lesson, people usually use __configuration files__ rather than code, to setup loggers/handlers.



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging

# Create a custom logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.propagate = False # do not pass logs to the default logger

# Create handlers
c_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
f_handler = logging.FileHandler('file.log', mode='w')
c_handler.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
f_handler.setLevel(logging.ERROR)

# Create formatters and add it to handlers
c_format = logging.Formatter('%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
f_format = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
c_handler.setFormatter(c_format)
f_handler.setFormatter(f_format)

# Add handlers to the logger
logger.addHandler(c_handler)
logger.addHandler(f_handler)

logger.warning('This is a warning')
logger.error('This is an error')

```
</div>

</div>



Here, `logger.warning()` is creating a `LogRecord` that holds all the information of the event and passing it to all the Handlers that it has: `c_handler` and `f_handler`.

- `c_handler` is a `StreamHandler` with level `WARNING` and takes the info from the LogRecord to generate an output in the format specified and prints it to the console. 
- `f_handler` is a `FileHandler` with level `ERROR`, and it ignores this LogRecord as its level is WARNING.

When `logger.error()` is called, `c_handler` behaves exactly as before, and `f_handler` gets a LogRecord at the level of `ERROR`, so it proceeds to generate an output just like c_handler, but instead of printing it to console, it writes it to the specified file:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
print(open('file.log').read())

```
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper" markdown="1">
<div class="output_subarea" markdown="1">
{:.output_stream}
```
2019-12-25 23:51:15,440 - __main__ - ERROR - This is an error

```
</div>
</div>
</div>



## Using configuration files
While it is possible to configure logging as shown above using the module and class functions, it is more flexible and useful to use configuration files for this

We can configure logging by creating a config file or a dictionary and loading it using `fileConfig()` or `dictConfig()` respectively. These are useful in case you want to change your logging configuration in a running application.

Here‚Äôs an example file configuration:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%file example.conf

[loggers]
keys=root,sampleLogger

[handlers]
keys=consoleHandler

[formatters]
keys=sampleFormatter

[logger_root]
level=DEBUG
handlers=consoleHandler

[logger_sampleLogger]
level=DEBUG
handlers=consoleHandler
qualname=sampleLogger
propagate=0

[handler_consoleHandler]
class=StreamHandler
level=DEBUG
formatter=sampleFormatter
args=(sys.stdout,)

[formatter_sampleFormatter]
format=%(asctime)s | %(levelname)-7s | %(name)s - %(message)s

```
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper" markdown="1">
<div class="output_subarea" markdown="1">
{:.output_stream}
```
Overwriting example.conf
```
</div>
</div>
</div>



In the above file, there are two loggers, one handler, and one formatter. After their names are defined, they are configured by adding the words logger, handler, and formatter before their names separated by an underscore.

To load this config file, you have to use fileConfig():



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging
import logging.config

logging.config.fileConfig(fname='example.conf', disable_existing_loggers=False)

# Get the logger specified in the file
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.debug('This is a debug message')

```
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper" markdown="1">
<div class="output_subarea" markdown="1">
{:.output_stream}
```
2019-12-25 23:51:15,575 | DEBUG   | __main__ - This is a debug message
```
</div>
</div>
</div>



The path of the config file is passed as a parameter to the `fileConfig()` method, and the `disable_existing_loggers` parameter is used to keep or disable the loggers that are present when the function is called. It defaults to True if not mentioned.



Here‚Äôs the same configuration in a YAML format for the dictionary approach:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%file config.yaml

version: 1
formatters:
  simple:
    format: '%(asctime)s | %(levelname)-7s | %(name)s - %(message)s'
handlers:
  console:
    class: logging.StreamHandler
    level: DEBUG
    formatter: simple
    stream: ext://sys.stdout
loggers:
  sampleLogger:
    level: DEBUG
    handlers: [console]
    propagate: no
root:
  level: DEBUG
  handlers: [console]


```
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper" markdown="1">
<div class="output_subarea" markdown="1">
{:.output_stream}
```
Overwriting config.yaml
```
</div>
</div>
</div>



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python

import logging
import logging.config
import yaml

with open('config.yaml', 'r') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f.read())
    logging.config.dictConfig(config)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.debug('This is a debug message')


```
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper" markdown="1">
<div class="output_subarea" markdown="1">
{:.output_stream}
```
2019-12-25 23:51:15,720 | DEBUG   | __main__ - This is a debug message
```
</div>
</div>
</div>



the YAML configuration is usually considered cleaner and more preferrable, although the INI-style configuration has been around longer and is perhaps more well known.



# Understanding logging in-depth



## Loggers
Loggers are the application-level interface to the logging system. A system may have multiple different loggers, each with their own name and rules.

> it is good common practice for developers to have a logger per module

question: 
what would be the name of the logger in this file?

> ```
> # file: project/moduleA/submoduleX/x3.py
>    
> import logging
> logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
> logger.info('module initialized')
> ```

answer:
the variable `__name__` would expand to `"project.moduleA.submoduleX.x3"` which would be the name of the logger.

output from this program might look like this:

> `INFO    | project.moduleA.submoduleX.x3  - module initialized`
    
thus, when using `__name__` as the name of the logger, the name helps us localize a log message to a particular file in our project.


   



## Logger hierarchy
Loggers have a hierarchy. That is, you can create individual loggers and each logger has a parent. At the top of the hierarchy is the root logger. For instance, we could have the following loggers:

```
myapp
myapp.ui
myapp.ui.edit
```
These can be created by asking a parent logger for a new child logger:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
log_myapp = logging.getLogger("myapp")
log_myapp_ui = log_myapp.getChild("ui")
print(log_myapp_ui.name)        # 'myapp.ui'
print(log_myapp_ui.parent.name) # 'myapp'

```
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper" markdown="1">
<div class="output_subarea" markdown="1">
{:.output_stream}
```
myapp.ui
myapp
```
</div>
</div>
</div>



Or you can (__and should!__) use dot notation:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
log_myapp_ui = logging.getLogger("myapp.ui")
print(log_myapp_ui.name)        # 'myapp.ui'
print(log_myapp_ui.parent.name) # 'myapp'

```
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper" markdown="1">
<div class="output_subarea" markdown="1">
{:.output_stream}
```
myapp.ui
myapp
```
</div>
</div>
</div>



You should use the dot notation generally.

One thing that‚Äôs not immediately clear is that the logger names don‚Äôt include the root logger. In actuality, the logger hierarchy looks like this:

```
root.myapp
root.myapp.ui
root.myapp.ui.edit
```

More on the root logger in a bit.



### inheritance
To understand how the logger hierachy is useful, we need to understand how loggers are structured. If you look at most functional apps you won‚Äôt see any specific logger names getting looked up in application code. You‚Äôll see something similar to the following:

```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```
`__name__` is a built-in Python variable that evaluates to the current module. So in the module `project/app/tests`, `__name__` will evaluate to `project.app.tests`. That doesn‚Äôt mean that the project has explicitly defined a logger named `project.app.tests`. This is where inheritance comes into the picture.

Python loggers are organized in a parent-child structure with a hierarchy similar to module namespacing. Every application has a main logger that is never (or should never be) used directly. Child loggers point back to parent loggers, which eventually point to the main logger. Names are defined using dot-notation, so the name `parent_logger.child_logger` denotes a child_logger which ‚Äúinherits‚Äù from a logger named parent_logger.

The child can inherit a log level from the parent, and if we look up a logger that hasn‚Äôt explicitly been defined in the logging configuration then logging will create that logger and move up the inheritance tree until one is explicitly defined. The new logger will then inherit that logger‚Äôs log-level. So if project.app.tests isn‚Äôt defined, logging will check if project.app is defined and use that log-level. If that isn‚Äôt defined it will try project. If this still isn‚Äôt defined then the root logger will be used.

Benefits of the parent-child architecture:

1. General behavior can be added to parent loggers and specific behavior can be added to child loggers.
2. Naming and relationships follow the structure that Python already uses for imports, so we don‚Äôt need a new mental model.
3. It allows us to use module-specific loggers without explicitly configuring them.



### Propagation
If we create a new logger dynamically at runtime then that logger won‚Äôt have any handlers of its own. It also doesn‚Äôt inherit them from its parent. So how does that `LogRecord` get to a handler?

This problem is solved via propagation. Propagation means passing a log from a child logger to a parent logger‚Äôs handlers, which is the default behavior. This means that a `LogRecord` created by child_logger will first get sent to child_logger‚Äôs handlers and then if `child_logger.propagate == True` it will get passed to the parent logger. The parent logger will then bypass its own filters and send the LogRecord directly to its handlers. If `parent_logger.propagate == True` this passing will continue until the logger reaches the root logger, or until an ancestor has propagate set to `False`.

![](https://i1.wp.com/djangodeconstructed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/InheritancePropagation.png?zoom=1.25&resize=351%2C261&ssl=1)

A common design that takes advantage of this hierarchy involves only adding handlers to the root or project-level logger and then adding filters to the application‚Äôs child loggers. Module-level loggers are then responsible for what gets logged but the decision of where to send the final LogRecord is controlled at the root-level.

Propagation is useful because, without it, a module-level logger that doesn‚Äôt have it‚Äôs own handlers wouldn‚Äôt actually do anything with the logs it creates. Because of propagation, we can create a new module, lookup the logger for that specific module via the `__name__` variable, and immediately have a new logger that inherits a log-level and propagates its logs up to its parent‚Äôs handlers.



## Log levels and message propagation
Each logger can have a log level. When you send a message to a logger, you specify the log level of the message. If the level matches, the message is then propagated up the hierarchy of loggers. One of the biggest misconceptions I had was that I thought each logger checked the level of the message and if it the level of the message is lower or equal, the logger‚Äôs handler would be invoked. This is not true!

What happens instead is that the level of the message is only checked by the logger you give the message to. If the message‚Äôs level is lower or equal to the logger‚Äôs, the message is propagated up the hierarchy, but none of the other loggers will check the level! They‚Äôll simply invoke their handlers.



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python
import logging

log_myapp = logging.getLogger("myapp")
log_myapp_ui = logging.getLogger("myapp.ui")

logging.basicConfig()
log_myapp.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
log_myapp_ui.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
log_myapp_ui.debug('test')

```
</div>

</div>



In the example above, the root logger has a handler that prints the message. Even though the ‚Äúlog_myapp‚Äù handler has a level of ERROR, the DEBUG message is still propagated to to the root logger. This image (from the python logging docs) shows why:

![](https://docs.python.org/2/_images/logging_flow.png)

As you can see, when giving a message to a logger, the logger checks the level. After that, the level on the loggers is no longer checked and all handlers in the entire chain are invoked, regardless of level. Note that you can set levels on handlers as well. This is useful if you want to, for example, create a debugging log file but only show warnings and errors on the console.

It‚Äôs also worth noting that by default, loggers have a level of 0. This means __they use the log level of the first parent logger that has an actual level set__. This is determined at message-time, not when the logger is created.



## The root logger
The logging tutorial for Python explains that to configure logging, you can use basicConfig():

`logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log',level=logging.DEBUG)`

It‚Äôs not immediately obvious, but what this does is configure the root logger. Doing this may cause some counter-intuitive behaviour, because it causes debugging output for all loggers in your program, including every library that uses logging. 

> Some modules, like the famous `requests` module uses logging. This is why the requests module suddenly starts outputting debug information when you configure the root logger.

In general, your program or library shouldn‚Äôt log directly against the root logger. Instead configure a specific ‚Äúmain‚Äù logger for your program and put all the other loggers under that logger. This way, you can toggle logging for your specific program on and off by setting the level of the main logger. If you‚Äôre still interested in debugging information for all the libraries you‚Äôre using, feel free to configure the root logger. 

There are more pitfalls when it comes to the root logger. If you call any of the module-level logging methods, the root logger is automatically configured in the background for you. This goes completely against Python‚Äôs ‚Äúexplicit is better than implicit‚Äù rule:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
%%python
import logging
logging.warning("uhoh")

```
</div>

</div>



In the example above, I never configured a handler. It was done automatically. And on the root handler no less. This will cause all kinds of logging output from libraries you might not want. So don‚Äôt use the `logging.warning()`, `logging.error()` and other module-level methods. Always log against a specific logger instance you got with `logging.getLogger()`.




## Debugging logging problems
When I run into weird logging problems such as no output, or double lines, I generally put the following debugging code at the point where I‚Äôm logging the message.

```python
log_to_debug = logging.getLogger("myapp.ui.edit")
while log_to_debug is not None:
    print "level: %s, name: %s, handlers: %s" % (log_to_debug.level,
                                                 log_to_debug.name,
                                                 log_to_debug.handlers)
    log_to_debug = log_to_debug.parent
```

which outputs:
```
level: 0, name: myapp.ui.edit, handlers: []
level: 0, name: myapp.ui, handlers: []
level: 0, name: myapp, handlers: []
level: 30, name: root, handlers: []
```

From this output it becomes obvious that all loggers use a level of 30, since their log levels are 0, which means the look up the hierarchy for the first logger with a non-zero level. I‚Äôve also not configured any handlers. If I was seeing double output, it‚Äôs probably because there is more than one handler configured.



## HANDLERS
Handlers answer the question ‚Äúnow that we have a log, where should we send it?‚Äù It could go to a file, to the console, get sent as an email, or other possible destinations. The exact behavior could differ depending on context as well. While on your local computer you may want the logs to go to the console so it‚Äôs easier to debug, if your code is in production you‚Äôll want a more robust logging setup.

To allow different behaviors, a single logger can send a LogRecord to multiple different handlers, each with their own rules for how to handle the log. setting this up usually happens through configuration



## Summary
- When you log a message, the level is only checked at the logger you logged the message against. If it passes, every handler on every logger up the hierarchy is called, regardless of that logger‚Äôs level.

- By default, loggers have a level of 0. This means they use the log level of the first parent logger that has an actual level set. This is determined at message-time, not when the logger is created.

- Don‚Äôt log directly against the root logger. That means: no logging.basicConfig() and no usage of module-level loggers such as logging.warning(), as they have unintended side-effects.

- Create a uniquely named top-level logger for your application / library and put all child loggers under that logger. Configure a handler for output on the top-level logger for your application. Don‚Äôt configure a level on your loggers, so that you can set a level at any point in the hierarchy and get logging output at that level for all underlying loggers. Note that this is an appropriate strategy for how I usually structure my programs. It might not be for you.

- The easiest way that‚Äôs usually correct is to use __name__ as the logger name: log = logging.getLogger(__name__). This uses the module hierarchy as the name, which is generally what you want. 

- Read the entire [logging HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html) and specifically the [Advanced Logging Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-advanced-tutorial), because it really should be called ‚Äúlogging basics‚Äù.



# Example



Lets create an example project with the following structure:

```
project/
/-- moduleA/
    /-- a1.py
    /-- submoduleX/
        /-- x1.py 
        /-- x2.py
/-- moduleB/
    /-- b1.py
```

and lets imagine we want to apply the following rules:
1. all logs with level WARNING and above should go to the console
2. all logs from moduleA (or its submodules) with level ERROR and above should go to file `moduleA.errors.log`
3. all logs from submoduleX with level INFO and above should go to file `submoduleX.info.log`
4. all logs from submoduleX.x2 with level DEBUG and above should go to file `x2.debug.log`
5. all logs from moduleB.b1 with level DEBUG and above should _ONLY_ go to `b1.log` and not to any other place

With logging, this requires no special coding, and is relatively easy to configure:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python

Overwriting project/project.yaml
```
</div>
</div>
</div>



Now lets create the example code files for our project:



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
from pathlib import Path

example_code = """
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def do_unimportant_thing():
    logger.debug('this information is for debugging')
    
def do_something():
    logger.info('doing something')

def warn_about_something():
    logger.warn('something could be wrong')

def some_error():
    logger.error('there seems to be an error')

"""

project_files = [
    'project/moduleA/a1.py',
    'project/moduleA/submoduleX/x1.py',
    'project/moduleA/submoduleX/x2.py',
    'project/moduleB/b1.py',
    ]

for path in [Path(f) for f in project_files]:
    path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    path.write_text(example_code)
    print('Created', path)


```
</div>

<div class="output_wrapper" markdown="1">
<div class="output_subarea" markdown="1">

Created project\moduleA\submoduleX\x1.py

Created project\moduleB\b1.py
```
</div>
</div>
</div>



and here's the test program which exercises all the methods of all the modules in our example project. 

the program also reads the `project.yaml` configuration file, and without writing code, routes the logs according to all the rules we wrote in the config file

import project.moduleB.b1 as b1

#logging.config.fileConfig('project.conf')

import yaml
from pathlib import Path

config = yaml.safe_load(Path('project/project.yaml').read_text())
logging.config.dictConfig(config)

for module in [a1, x1, x2, b1]:
    module.do_unimportant_thing()
    module.do_something()
    module.warn_about_something()
    module.some_error()

</div>
