You can (and should) define your own logger by creating an object of the Logger class, especially if your application has multiple modules. Let‚Äôs have a look at some of the classes and functions in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used classes defined in the logging module are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Logger`: This is the class whose objects will be used in the application code directly to call the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LogRecord`: Loggers automatically create LogRecord objects that have all the information related to the event being logged, like the name of the logger, the function, the line number, the message, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Handler`: Handlers send the LogRecord to the required output destination, like the console or a file. Handler is a base for subclasses like StreamHandler, FileHandler, SMTPHandler, HTTPHandler, and more. These subclasses send the logging outputs to corresponding destinations, like sys.stdout or a disk file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Formatter`: This is where you specify the format of the output by specifying a string format that lists out the attributes that the output should contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "we'll talk more in depth about all of these below, right now we're keeping to the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of these, we mostly deal directly with the objects of the Logger class, which are instantiated using the module-level function `logging.getLogger(name)`. Multiple calls to `getLogger()` with the same name will return a reference to the same Logger object, which saves us from passing the logger objects to every part where it‚Äôs needed. \n",

    "```python\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "`__name__` is a built-in Python variable that evaluates to the current module. So in the module `project/app/tests`, `__name__` will evaluate to `project.app.tests`. That doesn‚Äôt mean that the project has explicitly defined a logger named `project.app.tests`. This is where inheritance comes into the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python loggers are organized in a parent-child structure with a hierarchy similar to module namespacing. Every application has a main logger that is never (or should never be) used directly. Child loggers point back to parent loggers, which eventually point to the main logger. Names are defined using dot-notation, so the name `parent_logger.child_logger` denotes a child_logger which ‚Äúinherits‚Äù from a logger named parent_logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The child can inherit a log level from the parent, and if we look up a logger that hasn‚Äôt explicitly been defined in the logging configuration then logging will create that logger and move up the inheritance tree until one is explicitly defined. The new logger will then inherit that logger‚Äôs log-level. So if project.app.tests isn‚Äôt defined, logging will check if project.app is defined and use that log-level. If that isn‚Äôt defined it will try project. If this still isn‚Äôt defined then the root logger will be used.\n",

This means that a `LogRecord` created by child_logger will first get sent to child_logger‚Äôs handlers and then if `child_logger.propagate == True` it will get passed to the parent logger. The parent logger will then bypass its own filters and send the LogRecord directly to its handlers. If `parent_logger.propagate == True` this passing will continue until the logger reaches the root logger, or until an ancestor has propagate set to `False`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Propagation is useful because, without it, a module-level logger that doesn‚Äôt have it‚Äôs own handlers wouldn‚Äôt actually do anything with the logs it creates. Because of propagation, we can create a new module, lookup the logger for that specific module via the `__name__` variable, and immediately have a new logger that inherits a log-level and propagates its logs up to its parent‚Äôs handlers."

The exact behavior could differ depending on context as well. While on your local computer you may want the logs to go to the console so it‚Äôs easier to debug, if your code is in production you‚Äôll want a more robust logging setup.\n",

    "- When you log a message, the level is only checked at the logger you logged the message against. If it passes, every handler on every logger up the hierarchy is called, regardless of that logger‚Äôs level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, loggers have a level of 0. This means they use the log level of the first parent logger that has an actual level set. This is determined at message-time, not when the logger is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don‚Äôt log directly against the root logger. That means: no logging.basicConfig() and no usage of module-level loggers such as logging.warning(), as they have unintended side-effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a uniquely named top-level logger for your application / library and put all child loggers under that logger. Configure a handler for output on the top-level logger for your application. Don‚Äôt configure a level on your loggers, so that you can set a level at any point in the hierarchy and get logging output at that level for all underlying loggers. Note that this is an appropriate strategy for how I usually structure my programs. It might not be for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The easiest way that‚Äôs usually correct is to use __name__ as the logger name: log = logging.getLogger(__name__). This uses the module hierarchy as the name, which is generally what you want. \n",
